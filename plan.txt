I have three implementations of "search""

  - simple search using `includes?`
  - regex search
  - search using "fuzzy_match" gem

I test them in the following ways:

  - test each individual artist name to ensure that it is the only result (for `includes?` and regex) or the first result (for fuzzy match )
  - test searching for individual letters
  - test searching for individual letters in large files. This uses the `large_artists_list.yml` file which has 250,000 randomly generated "artist" names. 
  - Benchmark the different search methods

It's evident that the fuzzy_match method is far, far 
slower than others.
